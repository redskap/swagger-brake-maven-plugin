# Swagger Brake Maven plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/redskap/swagger-brake-maven-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/redskap/swagger-brake-maven-plugin)
Maven plugin for [Swagger Brake](https://github.com/redskap/swagger-brake).

The plugin is building on Swagger Brake's latest artifact resolution feature to determine the so 
called `old` version of the API thus it's mandatory to provide the repository URL which will be used
to download the proper artifact. If you want to skip the latest artifact resolution 
you can use a path to the latest version of your API to compare.

There are 2 properties which are mandatory for this reason:
- `mavenRepoUrl` or `mavenSnapshotUrl` or `oldApi`
- `newApi`

An example project can be found [here](https://github.com/redskap/swagger-brake-example/tree/master/swagger-brake-maven-example).
